 * Part 2 (square):
 * Assume a Square class which would inherit the Rectangle defined in Part 1. 
 * An object of Square class will have both sides equal (i.e. base=height) which 
 * are set to zero at the time of the creation of the object. The same functions 
 * (area and setValues) of the Rectangle class should be used in Square class 
 * too.
 * Write a JAVA source code declaration of the Square class inheriting the 
 * Rectangle class to behave according to the specification given above.
 * Write a fragment of client code which creates a Square object, sets its side 
 * to 8 and displays its area.
